<p>During my time at Penn State, I hesitated to fully commit to a mathematics degree.&#160; By the time I did finally commit to pursuing a math degree, I only had enough time to pursue a minor in mathematics.&#160; As a result, I felt as though I missed out on some of the many essential topics in mathematics beyond those I had the opportunity to study in college.&#160; One such topic is analysis.</p>
<p>To &#8203;compensate &#8203;for &#8203;this, &#8203;I &#8203;ended &#8203;up &#8203;buying &#8203;a &#8203;few &#8203;textbooks that I had planned to self-study and learn more about the continuous mathematics that I had missed out on in college.&#160; But of course, life gets in the way, and these books ended up sitting on my bookshelf for a few years.&#160; That is, until recently when I decided enough was enough, and I was finally going to commit to learning real analysis.<br></p>
<p>Many who have brushed the surface of mathematics likely have some top-down understanding of real analysis.&#160; This is because various results from real analysis serve as the theoretical underpinnings of calculus, such as continuity, differentiability, and who can forget, the fundamental theorem of calculus.&#160; But these results, albeit extremely practical, do not exactly lie at the very core of real analysis.&#160; Otherwise we might call real analysis "the theory of calculus".</p>

<p data-original-level="H2">Real analysis at its core answers a very simple question: what are the real numbers?&#160; We all have some rough understanding of what real numbers are.&#160; We know that real numbers can be written out using decimal notation, such as<lrn-math></lrn-math>




</p>
<p data-original-level="H2" data-text-align="center"><lrn-math mathtext="\pi = 3.141592...  "><span>\pi = 3.141592...  </span></lrn-math>




<lrn-math mathtext="  "> </lrn-math>




<lrn-math></lrn-math>




<lrn-math></lrn-math>




<br> </p>
<p>We &#8203;also &#8203;know that&#160;<lrn-math mathtext="\sqrt{2}  "><span>\sqrt{2}  </span></lrn-math>



 is a real number,&#160;<lrn-math mathtext="  5"><span>  5</span></lrn-math>



<lrn-math></lrn-math>



 is a real number, and&#160;<lrn-math mathtext="\frac{2}{3}  "><span>\frac{2}{3}  </span></lrn-math>



 is a real number.&#160; We also know that a function like&#160;<lrn-math mathtext="f(x) = x^{2}  "><span>f(x) = x^{2}  </span></lrn-math>



<lrn-math></lrn-math>



 can be plotted on the real plane&#160;<lrn-math></lrn-math>



<lrn-math mathtext="\mathbb{R}^{2}  "><span>\mathbb{R}^{2}  </span></lrn-math>



 like so.</p>

</p>
<p>But &#8203;nonetheless, &#8203;we &#8203;lack &#8203;a rigorous understanding of the real numbers.&#160; Our present understanding has been built upon a foundation of intuition and not a logically sound one.&#160; Real analysis provides the logically sound foundation atop which our intuitive understanding of the real numbers can rest safely.<br></p>
