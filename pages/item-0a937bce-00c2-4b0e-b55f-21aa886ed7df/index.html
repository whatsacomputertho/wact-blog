<p>To model a game as complex as American football requires a deep understanding of real-world football data.&#160; In this blog, I reflect on the exploratory data analysis and machine learning processes by which I was able to produce a model which randomly generates football box scores.</p>

<p>Now that I have the football box score data I need, I can start to explore it to better understand its characteristics and identify trends in the data that can be modeled.&#160; To do so, my best bet would be to use the various data science tools in the Python community, including <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" target="_blank">Pandas</a>, <a href="https://matplotlib.org/" target="_blank">Matplotlib</a>, and <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/" target="_blank">Scikit Learn</a>.</p>
<h3 data-original-level="H3" id="header-88835cb0-2358-2451-800e-55e7d7be28d1">Data &#8203;Labeling</h3>
<p>Recall &#8203;the fact that, for my model, I want to be able to accept each team's offensive and defensive skill levels as inputs, then randomly generate the result of their football game.&#160; The main challenge I faced when approaching the problem was simply that there are no skill levels explicitly given by the data.&#160; Instead, I would need to derive some sort of skill level for each team, and label the data with those skill levels for training my model.</p>
<p>To &#8203;derive &#8203;my skill levels, I first <a href="https://github.com/whatsacomputertho/fbdb-boxscore-eda/blob/0d7fc0b385ad52c59718ede9004bebcdb5a1c982/cli/boxscore.py#L49-L108" target="_blank" role="textbox">calculated the median, mean, and standard deviation points for and points against</a> for each team during each season of professional football on both offense and defense.&#160; I stored the summaries in two JSON files, <code>offense.json</code> and <code>defense.json</code>.<br></p>
<p>Then, I plotted <a href="https://github.com/whatsacomputertho/fbdb-boxscore-eda/blob/0d7fc0b385ad52c59718ede9004bebcdb5a1c982/cli/boxscore.py#L110-L157" target="_blank">the mean against the median (which are two highly correlated features) and produced a K-Means clustering</a> of the plotted data.&#160; The clustering successfully clustered each offense and defense into five clusters where teams are clustered by their performance in terms of average points for and points against.</p>

<p>I then <a href="https://github.com/whatsacomputertho/fbdb-boxscore-eda/blob/0d7fc0b385ad52c59718ede9004bebcdb5a1c982/cli/boxscore.py#L159-L239" target="_blank">went back through each year's individual box scores and labeled them</a> with each participating team's <code>offense_overall</code> and <code>defense_overall</code>.&#160; These values were integers ranging from 1-5 based on which cluster the team appeared in.&#160; If they were a high-scoring offense or low-scoring defense, they were assigned a 5; vice versa they were assigned a 1, and everything in between.</p>
<p>In my final pass through the data, I used each labeled box score to <a href="https://github.com/whatsacomputertho/fbdb-boxscore-eda/blob/0d7fc0b385ad52c59718ede9004bebcdb5a1c982/cli/labeled.py#L8-L30" target="_blank">generate data entries like so</a></p>
<code-sample type="json" copy-clipboard-button><template preserve-content="preserve-content">{
  "offense_defense_differential": 3,
  "score": 38,
  "is_home": false
}</template></code-sample>
<p>Which include the offense / defense skill differential (that is, the offense's skill minus the defense's skill), the score of the game, and whether the offense was the home team.<br></p>

<p>Now &#8203;that &#8203;all &#8203;of &#8203;my &#8203;box scores were labeled with each team's skill differentials (in whose accuracy I was confident enough), I could start to engage in some real EDA in pursuit of a suitable model.</p>
<p>The &#8203;first &#8203;thing &#8203;I &#8203;looked &#8203;at &#8203;was &#8203;simply <a href="https://github.com/whatsacomputertho/fbdb-boxscore-eda/blob/0d7fc0b385ad52c59718ede9004bebcdb5a1c982/cli/labeled.py#L83-L94" target="_blank">the performance of home versus away teams</a>.&#160; I wanted to answer the question - is there a measurable home field advantage in professional football?&#160; As it turns out, there is!</p>
<media-image source="files/scores-by-home-away.png" card citation="This is my citation." accent-color="grey" size="wide" offset="none" link="files/scores-by-home-away.png" disable-zoom></media-image>
<p>Here it can be seen that home teams historically have outscored away teams by roughly 2 to 3 points.&#160; I wasn't the first to discover this, <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nfl/nfl-odds-how-much-home-field-advantage-worth-spread" target="_blank">the sportsbooks generally recognize home field advantage to be 2.8 points</a> which seems to align with my findings here - a good sign over all.<br></p>
<p>Next, <a href="https://github.com/whatsacomputertho/fbdb-boxscore-eda/blob/0d7fc0b385ad52c59718ede9004bebcdb5a1c982/cli/labeled.py#L32-L59" target="_blank">I summarized all the scores from across each skill differential</a> to see if there were any apparent trends.&#160; I produced two files, <code>away.json</code> and <code>home.json</code>, each included data entries like so, one for each of the 9 skill differentials.</p>
<code-sample type="json" copy-clipboard-button><template preserve-content="preserve-content">{
  "norm_diff": 0.5,
  "mean_score": 19.3722963645,
  "std_score": 8.8825934299
}</template></code-sample>
<p>Here, &#8203;<code>norm_diff</code> represents the skill differential normalized into range [0, 1].&#160; Then the other two features are the mean and standard deviation of the scores observed across games in which an offense faced off against a defense with this skill differential between the two.</p>
<p>The summaries clearly indicated to me that there was a linear relationship between skill differential and mean score, which is exactly what I had hoped.&#160; I also sensed that there was a parabolic relationship between skill differential and standard deviation score, but I was less confident in my intuition on that one.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I ended up training four regression models, two for home teams and two for away teams.</p>
