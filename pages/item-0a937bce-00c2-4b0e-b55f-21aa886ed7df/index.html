<p>To model a game as complex as American football requires a deep understanding of real-world football data.&#160; In this blog, I reflect on the exploratory data analysis and machine learning processes by which I was able to produce a model which randomly generates football box scores.</p>

<p>Now that I have the football box score data I need, I can start to explore it to better understand its characteristics and identify trends in the data that can be modeled.&#160; To do so, my best bet would be to use the various data science tools in the Python community, including <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" target="_blank">Pandas</a>, <a href="https://matplotlib.org/" target="_blank">Matplotlib</a>, and <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/" target="_blank">Scikit Learn</a>.</p>

<p>Recall &#8203;the fact that, for my model, I want to be able to accept each team's offensive and defensive skill levels as inputs, then randomly generate the result of their football game.&#160; The main challenge I faced when approaching the problem was simply that there are no skill levels explicitly given by the data.&#160; Instead, I would need to derive some sort of skill level for each team, and label the data with those skill levels for training my model.</p>
<p>To &#8203;derive &#8203;my skill levels, I first <a href="https://github.com/whatsacomputertho/fbdb-boxscore-eda/blob/0d7fc0b385ad52c59718ede9004bebcdb5a1c982/cli/boxscore.py#L49-L108" target="_blank" role="textbox">calculated the median, mean, and standard deviation points for and points against</a> for each team during each season of professional football on both offense and defense.&#160; I stored the summaries in two JSON files, <code>offense.json</code> and <code>defense.json</code>.<br></p>
<p>Then, I plotted <a href="https://github.com/whatsacomputertho/fbdb-boxscore-eda/blob/0d7fc0b385ad52c59718ede9004bebcdb5a1c982/cli/boxscore.py#L110-L157" target="_blank">the mean against the median (which are two highly correlated features) and produced a K-Means clustering</a> of the plotted data.&#160; The clustering successfully clustered each offense and defense into five clusters where teams are clustered by their performance in terms of average points for and points against.</p>
