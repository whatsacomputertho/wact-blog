<p>The What's next for FootballSim now that the MVP is complete?&#160; There are various aspects of FootballSim that&#160;I think need improvement.&#160; Each of these enhancements vary in terms of their timeline (short-term versus long-term) and their "well-definedness".&#160; Here, I will collect my thoughts following my MVP &#8203;regarding &#8203;next &#8203;steps for FootballSim.</p>
<h2 data-original-level="H2" id="header-e98e75a4-3a54-9f50-80d8-54e4c6e5ae2d">Short-term &#8203;next &#8203;steps</h2>
<p>There are a few things I described throughout the initial FootballSim blog series as "what I would have done differently in retrospect".&#160; I think these observations serve as really great low-hanging fruit for me to cover right away. &#8203; &#8203;I &#8203;went &#8203;ahead &#8203;and &#8203;raised &#8203;issues for each of these findings:<br></p>
<ul><li role="textbox"><a href="https://github.com/whatsacomputertho/fbsim-deploy/issues/5" target="_blank">Parameterize domain name in fbsim-acme-responder and fbsim-proxy</a></li><li role="textbox"><a href="https://github.com/whatsacomputertho/fbsim-api/issues/4" target="_blank">Migrate ​FootballMatchup ​struct into fbsim-core library</a></li><li role="textbox"><a href="https://github.com/whatsacomputertho/fbsim-core/issues/7" target="_blank">Combine ​BoxScoreSimulator ​and ​BoxScoreGenerator ​structs</a></li><li role="textbox"><a href="https://github.com/whatsacomputertho/fbsim-ui/issues/3" target="_blank">Components ​should ​re-size ​for ​mobile ​window</a></li></ul>
<p>Throughout my initial usage of FootballSim, I noticed that the model would regularly generate some quite unlikely scores, like 19 and 29.&#160; Furthermore, ties seemed to happen much more frequently than they should.&#160; Both of these observations are purely intuitive, but I think upon further investigation they will be measurable and fixable.&#160; I raised a few issues for this:<br></p>
<ul><li role="textbox"><a href="https://github.com/whatsacomputertho/fbdb-boxscore-eda/issues/4" target="_blank">Produce ​score ​distribution ​histogram and ​lookup table</a></li><li role="textbox"><a href="https://github.com/whatsacomputertho/fbsim-core/issues/6" target="_blank">Filter ​scores ​through ​frequency ​lookup ​table</a></li><li role="textbox"><a href="https://github.com/whatsacomputertho/fbdb-boxscore-eda/issues/6" target="_blank">Estimate overall tie probability, tie probability by skill differential</a></li><li role="textbox"><a href="https://github.com/whatsacomputertho/fbsim-core/issues/15" target="_blank">Re-simulate ​game ​in ​the ​event ​of ​a ​tie ​based ​on ​observed ​tie ​probability</a></li><li role="textbox"><a href="https://github.com/whatsacomputertho/fbsim-core/issues/14" target="_blank">Validate ​final ​score ​generator ​model</a></li></ul>
<p>As far as short-term improvements are concerned, this pretty much covers what I was able to determine with the help of my brother.&#160; Going forward, I think it would be good to build up a slightly broader feedback loop.&#160; There are surely things that need improvement that flew over my head, but that others will notice almost immediately.&#160; These are the things I'd like to uncover.&#160; As such, I might consider running some form of alpha testing fairly soon.</p>
<p>Once I gather a decent amount of feedback through alpha testing (and possibly beta testing), I'll plan to release an "official" v1.0.0 release of FootballSim.&#160; In the process, I may need to make some CI/CD enhancements here and there, and establish a branching strategy for my repositories.<br></p>
<h2 id="header-bc4e1f24-07d5-9959-d121-232cab20adfc">Medium-term next steps<br></h2>
<p>I'm starting to plan out a few new capabilities on top of, or in addition to, the existing FootballSim final score generator model.&#160; Thinking in terms of SemVer, I view these capabilities ultimately as minor releases, since they would just extend existing capabilities and not fundamentally re-work the API. &#8203; &#8203;That said, these would be larger projects that would need to be fleshed out over the course of multiple weeks.<br></p>
<p>For now, I've just planned a single issue for each project.&#160; I plan to treat these as "epics" which will contain individual stories underneath them for each underlying FootballSim component that needs work related to the larger project.</p>
<ol><li role="textbox"><a href="https://github.com/whatsacomputertho/fbsim-core/issues/11" target="_blank">Implement ​league ​simulation ​capability</a></li><li role="textbox"><a href="https://github.com/whatsacomputertho/fbsim-core/issues/12" target="_blank">Implement ​quarterly ​box score model</a></li></ol>
<p>The &#8203;first epic,&#160;<a href="https://github.com/whatsacomputertho/fbsim-core/issues/11" target="_blank">Implement ​league ​simulation ​capability</a>, is inspired by the spreadsheet that my brother and I are using to orchestrate our mini football league.&#160; The spreadsheet lists each team, their skill levels on offense and defense, their logos, their conference, and their division.&#160; It further includes the schedule for the season, the playoff picture, and the playoff bracket, all of which we wrote up entirely manually.&#160; It would be incredibly useful if we could simply declare and/or generate this all automatically.</p>
<p>The second epic, <a href="https://github.com/whatsacomputertho/fbsim-core/issues/12" target="_blank">Implement ​quarterly ​box score model</a>, is in the spirit of incrementally drilling down to finer and finer-grained models as I iterate on FootballSim.&#160; What's more, one of the emerging core pillars of FootballSim is&#160;<b>narrative context</b>.&#160; We want the ability to analyze the games and develop our own narratives around them, and storylines for our imaginary teams.&#160; Generating a quarter-by-quarter score breakdown will enhance this experience by allowing us to identify fun things like &#8203;late-game comebacks and overtime games.</p>
<p>Long-term next steps</p>
<p>The&#160;goal of this entire project has always been to produce a play-by-play model which can generate a full game log, and player statistics.&#160; I've started to write out a high-level epic encapsulating this large-scale goal: <a href=".https://github.com/whatsacomputertho/fbsim-core/issues/13" target="_blank">Implement play-by-play model</a>.</p>
<p>With &#8203;the &#8203;work &#8203;I &#8203;have to do that I'm viewing as short and medium-term, I think it's safe to say that we're still a ways away from this play-by-play model.&#160; That said, that will not stop me from dreaming about what this play-by-play model might look like when it's finally implemented.&#160; A while back (in one of my prior failed iterations), I drew up a mid-fidelity prototype of the UI that I might aim for:</p>
