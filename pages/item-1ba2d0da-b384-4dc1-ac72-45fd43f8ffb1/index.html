I've found that everyone has a unique story to tell about how they became a software engineer.&#160; This project is my story.</p>
<h2 data-original-level="H2" id="header-88219096-8d4a-366a-87d9-9ee811dc4e87">Background</h2>
<p>As long as I can remember, my brother and I played football together in our back yard.&#160; We would each play on imaginary football teams in an imaginary football league.&#160; Our teams consisted of everyone from family and friends, to video game characters, to imaginary characters that we made up along the way.&#160; We were so into our imaginary <i>mini football</i> league that we ended up writing spreadsheets including historic team rosters, game results, league champions, MVPs, and even a Hall of Fame.<br></p>
<p>A few years later, after my brother had gone away for college, we discovered <a href="https://www.brantsteele.com/" target="_blank">brantsteele.com</a>.&#160; This website hosts various simulator games based on popular reality TV shows, where one can plug in custom characters and simulate a season of that reality TV show.&#160; We immediately revisited our mini football days and simulated season after season of Survivor in which our imaginary characters competed to win the $1 million challenge.</p>
<p>That &#8203;got &#8203;me &#8203;thinking, &#8203;what if we had a simulator like this, but for football?&#160; It was hard to find anything out there matching my niche requirements.&#160; The Madden NFL football video games were the closest match, but they didn't quite my needs for simplicity and customization.</p>
<p>So it was at&#160;that point that 18-year-old me decided that me and my zero software engineering skills could easily hack something together instead.&#160; In the years that followed...</p>
<ul><li role="textbox">I ​taught myself the fundamentals of JavaScript and started developing my project<br></li><li role="textbox">I iterated through at least 5 variations of this project, none of which actually worked</li><li role="textbox">I ​left for ​college ​to study ​software ​engineering ​as I clearly lacked skills<br></li><li role="textbox">I spent 4 years at Penn State University studying software engineering and mathematics</li><li role="textbox">I ​interned, and later accepted a full-time software engineering job, at IBM </li><li role="textbox">I ​worked ​for ​nearly 3 ​years ​at ​IBM ​in my real-world software engineering role</li></ul>
<p>After &#8203;all &#8203;this &#8203;time (&#8203;7 &#8203;years &#8203;total &#8203;to &#8203;be &#8203;exact) I am proud to announce that I have finally developed a working implementation of my football simulator.&#160; My brother and I are now using it to simulate our beloved mini football league, and we are having a blast doing so.</p>
<p>In &#8203;this &#8203;blog &#8203;series, &#8203;I &#8203;will provide a technical overview of how I designed, architected, and implemented my football simulator game.<br></p>
<h2 data-original-level="H2" id="header-0f9449d0-7dde-118f-cfb4-d5003c0f68a4">Scope</h2>
<p>As I've grown as a software engineer, I've learned of the value of properly scoping software projects.&#160; I've also learned through personal experience that pet projects are especially vulnerable to improper scoping.&#160; This is partially due to our passion and personal connection to them - we strive for perfection out of our pet projects and as a result they never fully come to fruition.</p>
<p>With this iteration of my football simulator game, I imposed a very well-defined scope to keep myself accountable, and my goals realistic.&#160; My plan was to first approach the problem from the highest level and slowly drill down into the finer-grained details as I progress.</p>
<p id="header-96cc519f-c179-259e-67d4-9a1b2229264a">My goal was to implement a machine learning model that can randomly generate the final score of a football game (sometimes called a "<b>Box Score</b>") given each team's offensive and defensive skill levels.&#160; My initial requirements were as follows.<br></p>
<ul><li role="textbox">The model should be a good fit against real football data, meaning there
 will be some initial data science involved before any real development 
occurs.</li><li role="textbox">Once implemented, the model itself and supporting utilities 
should be packaged as a library atop which a CLI and API can later be 
implemented.</li><li role="textbox">A ​single-page web UI should be developed which interacts with the API.</li><li role="textbox">The build &amp; deployment of the full stack should be simple, repeatable, and semi-automated for both local and production deployments.<br></li></ul>
<p>In this series of blogs I will walk through my progress on each pillar of this project's first iteration, from the data science, to the web development, to the CI/CD, and everything in-between.&#160; Once this first iteration is completed, I will assess my progress and determine how I plan to approach my next iteration in a new blog series.<br></p>
