<p>It's &#8203;been &#8203;roughly two years since graduating from Penn State's Schreyer Honors College and joining IBM as a full-time software engineer. &#8203; &#8203;During &#8203;this &#8203;time, &#8203;I've &#8203;had the chance to explore my field at a very high-level, and understand a bit better who I am as an engineer, and as a person.<br></p>
<p>First and foremost, my heart belongs to mathematics.&#160; Ever since the early days of my college education, I was fascinated by the beauty, elegance, and philosophy behind mathematics.&#160; I now feel incomplete any time I am not learning or actively working on something that is rooted in mathematics.</p>
<p>Next, &#8203;I &#8203;love software engineering, and am blessed to have the opportunity to make a living writing software.&#160; Software is unique in its ability to connect people across the world, and the community built around software is a major part of what drew me into it as a profession.&#160; I am now growing to learn the importance of thankless, active participation in the broader software community, and building eminence in one's personal brand the process.<br></p>
<p>Believe it or not, the platform on which this blog is written (<a href="https://github.com/haxtheweb" target="_blank">HAX CMS</a>) is free, open source, and community-driven software.&#160; Moreover, it is thanklessly maintained by a former professor of mine; a professor who has mastered the art of building eminence through thankless contribution into the broader software community.&#160; His contributions played a major role in my success in my first few years at IBM.<br></p>
<p>I was able to hit the ground running in my cloud-native software engineering job thanks to his coverage of containerization &#38; container orchestration in our courses.&#160; These emerging technologies are early enough in their lifecycle that a traditional CS education does not cover them.&#160; Meanwhile they lie at the very core of the modern software development industry.&#8203;&#160; Thus, I wanted to publish my blogs on HAX to return my thanks to him, and feed into the community he has managed to cultivate over many years while also building my own eminence in the process.</p>
<p>Looking forward, I plan to write&#160;mainly about the technical work I do in my free time.&#160; In particular, lately I've been reading into a lot of analysis and wanted to use this as a place where I can reflect on my learning and share some interesting things I learn in the process.&#160; I also have developed many personal software projects over the past two years (with more planned for the future) which I plan to write about here.<br></p>
<p>I do so in hopes of exploring and contributing into the communities that have been built around these topics that I love.&#160; I have no schedule, no plan, I am just jumping into this as an experiment to see what comes of it.</p>
