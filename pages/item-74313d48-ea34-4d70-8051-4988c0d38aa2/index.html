<p>Nearly a year ago, I came across a book selling for $3 at a small-town thrift store which caught my eye.&#160; The book is called&#160;<i>Urban Farming</i> by Thomas J. Fox.&#160; It covers the topic of urban agriculture both at a bird's eye view, thinking very abstractly and globally about current problems which can be partially mitigated by urban agriculture, and from the more narrow perspective of a do-it-yourself urban gardener.</p>
<p>Among the various topics I find intriguing surrounding gardening and agriculture, one topic in particular stood out to me - soil science.&#160; Soil lies at the very core of agriculture, which itself lies at the very core of any functional society.&#160; It could be argued that we must first engineer soil for crop production before we can really engineer anything else.&#160; Hence, soil has a long history of being engineered for human needs.</p>
<p>What's more, the science underlying soil engineering is rooted in complex biochemistry and microecology.&#160; Soil provides a home for millions of species of microorganisms which often form symbiotic relationships with plants.&#160; These symbiotic relationships often involve the microorganisms performing some complex chemical process for the plant in exchange for a portion of the plant's resources.</p>
<p>Soil science is a particularly interesting topic in part because the aforementioned chemical processes often have not been reproduced in a scalable way by human chemical engineering.&#160; That is, outside of selectively breeding the plants and soil responsible for &#8203;executing those chemical processes on our behalf.&#160; From this perspective, the potential for soil science to serve as a catalyst for breakthroughs in chemical engineering can be seen clearly.</p>
<p>In &#8203;this &#8203;series &#8203;of &#8203;blogs, &#8203;I &#8203;would like to document the findings I make as I continue to read into soil science and engineering.<br></p>
